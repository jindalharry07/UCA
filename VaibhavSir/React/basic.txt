REACT

It is matained by meta
functionality of like, comment and posting
they wanted to do these functionalities to be very fast 

how the user click on like then in backend all the calls process which that time 

they thought that put no. of likes in local state and updates

----------------------                                              ------------------------
-    Frontend        -       User hits like button      ------->    -      Backend server  -
-                    -                                              -                      -
-   eg facebook.com  -       No. of likes on UI         <-------    -                      -
-                    -                                              -                      -

Now What happens in React 
----------------------                                              ------------------------

-   eg facebook.com  -       No. of likes on UI         <-------    -                      -
-                    -                                              -                      -

Created Virtual DOM 

Its copy of real dom when data comes from user change in virtual dom 
when user refresh the site then virtual changes the real dom only that part which is changed

converted the small functionality in project 
and used in multiple places



react is libary  -- // library is a piece of code that can be  utilised in exisitng application to make things easier to do
- used to create small components

nextjs is not libary its ramework is a complete project completey owns


-- diff btw libary and framework

React recomendes next js to be used as framework


browser download jsx file at end then check if their is jsx file and then convert it it is fetched as xhr(XMLHttpRequest)

if we use js type as module then we have t import and export
if script.js file become module then complete project become modeule


why virtual dom comes to function ?
-> if multiple upadate comes then dom hangs Dom operation are heavy and expensive react cannot optimise that
-> react creates a virtual dom (proper js object) and now update comes in virtual dom not directly in dom then react group the updates in batch and transfer it to dom batch by batch (it minimise the number of update on actual dom) 100 updates can be conerted into 10 batches.

- Virtual dom will push only that part in actual dom which is ectually change in dom

- Not a good practice to modify argument but we can modify


RE RENDER 
when fun is rerender the variables are made again and agaian in function insides it calss again and agaianto prevent this we uses hooks

Hooks->> These are the methods or function provided by react in order to do something custom while the component is re rendering, unmounting etc, or even to trigger a render, to manage where
to manage when the component is flushed out of the dom

Hooks let you control:
- When something happens (e.g., after render, before unmount)
- How your component manages and updates state
- Where to run certain code related to the component lifecycle, without using class-based lifecycle methods.

Component is updated/ re-renderes in 3 cases
1. Props Change
2. state change    
3. Parent component re-renders


1. Use State 
used to change the value in dom react cause re-render 
returns the array
-> In js if we render dynamic then all the tag will re render but in react only the value is re render

2. Use Effect
takes 2 arguments 1 -> what to do 2-> when to do
when to do ->{
  - empty array -[] - do it only once when the component is mounted
  - no array - do it everytime the componemt is rendered
  - array with variable - [var1, var2] - do it only when any of these variables changes
}

‚öñ Main Difference Table
Feature	useState	                              useEffect
Purpose	To store and update local state	       To perform side effects (API calls, DOM updates, etc.)
When it runs	During rendering	               After rendering (and on dependency changes)
Input	Initial state value	                     A function (effect callback) + dependency array
Output	State variable + setter function	     Runs a side effect function
Example use	Counter, form inputs	             API calls, subscriptions, timers



3. useRef ‚Äî What It Is & Why It's Useful
useRef() is a React hook that returns a mutable object with a .current property.
const myRef = React.useRef(initialValue);

eg- const tempvariable = React.useRef(10); // doesn't re made in rerender

üß† Key Features of useRef:
Feature	Description
‚úÖ Mutable	You can change .current without causing a re-render
‚úÖ Persistent	The .current value persists across renders
‚ùå No re-render	Changing .current does not trigger a re-render
‚úÖ DOM access	Can be used to reference actual DOM elements
