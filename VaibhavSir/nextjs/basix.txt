what is server side rendering ?
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where a web page is rendered on the server instead of the browser.

When a user visits a website:

Without SSR (Client-Side Rendering / CSR) — The browser first downloads a blank HTML page and JavaScript files. Then, JavaScript runs in the browser to build (render) the content dynamically.

With SSR — The server prepares the complete HTML page (with all the content already rendered) and sends it to the browser. The browser then just displays it.

// rendering techniques
CSR -> Client side rendering
SSR -> server side rendering
SSG -> static side generation
ISR -> Incremental static regeneration

most common use case is hybrid approach which is combination of all the above  hybrid - combination of all the above
 -> some of CSR
 -> some of SSR
 -> some of SSG
 -> some part of single page or application

// next js tries to render every component server side
"use client" there is a way to tell next js that use that component on client


Pm2 

layout.js file is entry point of next project

which component is made in page.js in run time auto goes in layout.js gives as children

React is single page application 
do do this ->
import Link from 'next/link';
<Link href="/login">Go to login</Link>
this is tag of next.js
does pre fetching

RSC react server side component


npm run build 
- build the app in production mode
npm run start

cant run localstorage features because next is server side it is client side (localstorage is browser feacture) // can use "use client" and useEffect shouble be used
