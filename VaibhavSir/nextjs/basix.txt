what is server side rendering ?
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where a web page is rendered on the server instead of the browser.

When a user visits a website:

Without SSR (Client-Side Rendering / CSR) — The browser first downloads a blank HTML page and JavaScript files. Then, JavaScript runs in the browser to build (render) the content dynamically.

With SSR — The server prepares the complete HTML page (with all the content already rendered) and sends it to the browser. The browser then just displays it.

// rendering techniques
CSR -> Client side rendering
SSR -> server side rendering
SSG -> static side generation
ISR -> Incremental static regeneration

most common use case is hybrid approach which is combination of all the above  hybrid - combination of all the above
 -> some of CSR
 -> some of SSR
 -> some of SSG
 -> some part of single page or application

// next js tries to render every component server side
 "use client" there is a way to tell next js that use that component on client
