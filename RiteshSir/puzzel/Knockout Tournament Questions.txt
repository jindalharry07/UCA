Knockout Tournament Questions
=====================================

Context:
---------
- Tournament starts with 2^n players.
- Matches are knockout style: loser eliminated in each match.
- Winner is the last player remaining.

---

Q1: How many matches to find the winner?

Answer:
- Every match eliminates exactly one player.
- To go from 2^n players down to 1 winner, total matches required:

2^n - 1

Q2: How many matches to find the second-best player?

Answer:
- The second-best player is among those who lost directly to the winner during the tournament.
- The winner plays exactly n matches (one in each round).
- To find the second-best, you need to find the best player among the winner’s opponents.
- Therefore, the total matches to find the second-best player are:

= Matches to find winner + Matches to determine the best among winner's opponents

- The number of winner’s opponents is n, so to find the best among them requires n - 1 additional matches.

Hence:

Total matches = (2^n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2^n + n - 2

Example:
---------
For n=3 (8 players):

- Matches to find winner = 2^3 - 1 = 7
- Matches among winner’s opponents to find second-best = 3 - 1 = 2
- Total matches to find both 1st and 2nd best:

7 + 2 = 9

Summary:
---------
| Question                        | Number of Matches               |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| To find winner                  | 2^n - 1                         |
| To find second-best (runner-up) | 2^n + n - 2                     |
