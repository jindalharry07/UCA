Caps Segregation Puzzle - Spatial Partitioning Approach
====================================

Problem Recap:
--------------
A group of people enters a room, each wearing either a White (W) or Black (B) cap.
- Each person can see everyone else's cap but not their own.
- Communication is not allowed after caps are worn.
- The goal is to segregate into groups based on cap colors without knowing your own cap.

---

Approach: Spatial Partitioning by Positioning "Between" Groups
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. The first person enters and stands anywhere (no information yet).

2. The second person sees the first and stands somewhere different (e.g., opposite side) to create an initial partition.

3. The third person observes the positions and caps of the first two people.
   - If the third person's cap matches one group, they stand close to that group.
   - Otherwise, they stand spatially **between** the groups to create a finer partition.

4. Each subsequent person enters and:
   - Observes the existing groups and partitions formed by people already standing.
   - Stands **between** two groups with different caps if they do not belong clearly to one.
   - Or stands close to their own cap group if identifiable by position.

Example Walkthrough with Numbered People:

Person | Cap | Positioning Description
-------|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      | W   | Stands anywhere initially.
2      | B   | Stands somewhere different from 1, creating a partition.
3      | B   | Sees 1 (W) and 2 (B), stands **between** 1st and 2nd person to refine partition.
4      | W   | Sees partition between 1 (W) and 3 (B), stands **between** 1st and 3rd person.
5      | W   | Sees partition between 4 (W) and 3 (B), stands **between** 4th and 3rd person.
...    | ... | Continues similarly, always positioning between existing partitions.

Intuition:
----------
- Each person uses visible cap colors and positions to decide where to stand.
- By standing between groups with different caps, people gradually create two distinct spatial clusters.
- No one needs to know their own cap color, yet groups self-segregate naturally.

---

Advantages:
-----------
- Simple, visual, and self-organizing.
- Works without knowledge of own cap color.
- Clusters become clearer as more people position themselves.

---

Limitations:
------------
- Requires strict adherence to the “stand between” rule.
- Early positioning crucial for clear partitions.
- Might face challenges if many caps are mixed closely initially.

---

Summary:
--------
This spatial partitioning approach allows people to segregate by cap color through relative positioning alone, leveraging visible information about others and a simple "stand between" strategy.
