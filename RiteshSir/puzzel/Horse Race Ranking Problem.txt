Horse Race Ranking Problem
===========================

Problem Statement:
------------------
There are 25 horses competing on a race track that has only 5 tracks. At a time, only 5 horses can race.

Question:
---------
What is the minimum number of races required to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fastest horses?

---

Step 1: Initial grouping

- Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5 horses each.
- Conduct 5 races, one for each group.
- After these 5 races, the relative ranking of horses within each group is known.

Races so far: 5

---

Step 2: Race the winners of each group

- Take the winners (fastest horses) from each group and race them in the 6th race.
- This race determines the fastest horse overall (the winner of this race).
- Also partially ranks the groups based on their fastest horses.

Races so far: 6

---

Step 3: Identify candidates for 2nd and 3rd place

- Suppose groups are named A, B, C, D, E with horses ranked within each group as:

  Group A: A1 > A2 > A3 > A4 > A5  
  Group B: B1 > B2 > B3 > B4 > B5  
  Group C: C1 > C2 > C3 > C4 > C5  
  Group D: D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 > D5  
  Group E: E1 > E2 > E3 > E4 > E5

- After the winners' race (6th race), suppose the order is:

  A1 (1st), B1 (2nd), C1 (3rd), D1, E1

- The fastest horse overall is A1.

--------------
--------------

Step 4: Determine potential 2nd and 3rd place horses

- The 2nd and 3rd best horses must be among:

  - A2 and A3 (horses from A that lost only to A1)
  - B1 and B2 (top two horses from group B, since B1 came 2nd in winners race)
  - C1 (3rd place in winners race)

- Horses from groups D and E cannot be 2nd or 3rd because they lost to faster horses in other groups.

---

Step 5: Final race for 2nd and 3rd places

- Race A2, A3, B1, B2, and C1 in the 7th race.
- The top two horses in this race are the 2nd and 3rd fastest overall.

Total races required:

| Step                                    | Races Count | Total Races |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Initial 5 group races                   | 5           | 5           |
| Winners race (race of 5 winners)        | 1           | 6           |
| Final race (candidates for 2nd and 3rd) | 1           | 7           |

---

Final Answer:
-------------

It takes a **minimum of 7 races** to determine the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fastest horses out of 25 when only 5 can race at a time.
